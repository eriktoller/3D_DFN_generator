# 3D_DFN_generator
A generator for a 3D Discrete Fracture Network (DFN)

The repository contains two different programs:
1. DFN generator
2. DFN viewer

## DFN generator
A program that generates a DFN based on:
- `bbox`: the bounding box for the DFN
- `num_frac`: numer of fractures
- `r_min`: minimum radius of a fracture
- `r_max`: maxium radius of a fracture

The DFN is save to a *.pkl'-file.

## DFN viewer
A program the plots a privously save DFN.
